_NRCan believes in supporting employees in achieving a working level ability in their second official language. Language training is available to indeterminate and term employees. Although the NRCan Language School is the preferred service provider, contracts with external providers may also be used._

_Training options offered by the NRCan Language School are as follows:_

- _Group Training - Full-time Training – 37.5 hours/week ($35/hour)_
- _Group Training - Part-Time Training – 6 hours/week (2 hours/session over 3 days) ($45/hour)_
- _Individual - Coaching – up to 5 one-hour sessions (in preparation of a scheduled SLE test date) ($45/hour)_

_Group training will be scheduled on a quarterly basis; whereas coaching is available on an ad hoc basis once an employee has been provided with a SLE testing date._

**_NOTE – Language training is based on demand and availability of the teachers. Submitting an application for language training does not guarantee a place in a session. Courses will only be offered if there is sufficient demand to fill a class (4-6 students)._**

_Should the NRCan Language School be unable to fulfill your training needs, an external provider may be considered. For external provider options, please_ [_contact your procurement advisor_](https://gcdocs.gc.ca/nrcan-rncan/llisapi.dll/link/19125621) _for confirmation of the procurement options available to you._
