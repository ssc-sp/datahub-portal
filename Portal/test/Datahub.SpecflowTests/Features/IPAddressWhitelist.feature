Feature: IP Address Whitelist
Allows a user to add an IP address to the whitelist of a cloud resource

#    Scenario: Add my IP address to the whitelist
#        Given a current user with a name of <name>
#        And an IP address of <ip_address>
#        When the user adds their current IP to the whitelist
#        Then the <ip_address> should be in the whitelist
#        And the <name> associated with <ip_address>
#
#    Examples:
#      | name        | ip_address      |
#      | my-firewall | 123.123.123.123 |
#
#    Scenario: Names should conform to Azure Firewall naming conventions
#        Given a firewall <name>
#        When the name is cleaned up for compliance
#        Then the <name> should be <cleaned_name>
#
#    Examples:
#      | name        | cleaned_name |
#      | my-firewall | my-firewall  |
#      | my_firewall | my-firewall  |
#      | my.firewall | my-firewall  |
#      | my firewall | my-firewall  |
#
#    Scenario: Add my existing IP address to the whitelist
#        Given a current user with a name of <name>
#        And an IP address of <ip_address>
#        And the <ip_address> is already in the whitelist with <existing_name>
#        When the user adds their current IP to the whitelist
#        Then the <ip_address> should be in the whitelist with <name>
#
#    Examples:
#      | name | ip_address      | existing_name |
#      | test | 123.123.123.123 | my-firewall   |
