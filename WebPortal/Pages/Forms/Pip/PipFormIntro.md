#### Plans for Future Audits and Evaluations

NRCan’s Integrated Audit and Evaluation Plan (IAEP) is prepared by the Audit and Evaluation Branch (AEB) and updated on an annual basis. It provides a roadmap outlining AEB’s planned audits and evaluations over the next five fiscal years. The Plan developed in accordance with the requirements of the Treasury Board (TB) Policy on Internal Audit, the Institute of Internal Auditors’ (IIA) International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, Section 42.1 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA), and the TB Policy on Results. Please consult the [current IAEP (2021-2026)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/transparency/reporting-and-accountability/plans-and-performance-reports/audit-and-evaluation/annual-plans/nrcan-2021-26-integrated-audit-and-evaluation-plan-summary/23728) for information on planned audits and evaluations related to this DRF Program, if any. Evaluation commitments introduced in TB submissions after the approval of this Plan will be reflected in next year’s update of the IAEP. Note that all new evaluation commitments require concurrence from NRCan’s Head of Evaluation (Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive).

#### Previous Audits and Evaluations

Program design and implementation should be informed by the findings of past audits, evaluations, and other reviews.
