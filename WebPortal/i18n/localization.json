These simulations will include things like service failure and recovery, hundreds of simultaneous users, and other exciting tests.  We hope that you will not notice any of these activities but, if you do, please grab a screenshot or shoot us an email to tell us about your experience.  We would very much appreciate some insight into what worked and what did not.  We may also ask you for feedback in the form of a short survey or group discussion.  This will help us to further narrow down any issues that may arise.",
