# What is the NRCan DataHub?

The NRCan DataHub project is an enterprise platform for storing, working with and collaborating on data initiatives.  It is a central location for NRCan users to store any kind of data with a unified portal to facilitate data discovery and management, performing collaborative analysis, manipulating data using advanced analytics tools, and conducting data science experiments.

## Data Projects

The DataHub makes it easy for multiple teams, labs or users to get access to ETL, Data Science or Analytical tools.

The web interface lets users browse data project, request access and work with the following tools:
- **PowerBI Workspaces:** Each data project can be associated with its own workspace.
- **Storage Explorer & Databricks:** For data science projects, a separate storage account and a databricks workspace are created. The portal includes a user friendly drag and drop user interface to browse the account, upload and download files.
- **Form Builder**: DataHub include a data model manager that lets user design data models which can be converted into Entity Framework Models and connected to Blazor Forms.
- **Data Entry**: Once deployed into a web application, the forms designed with the form builder can be accessed for each data project and convert complex legacy spreadsheets into user friendly web applications.

## System Architecture

The diagram below shows the key components of the platform
